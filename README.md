# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #965 [Easy] 

This problem was asked by Google.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, â‚¬,
corresponds to the three bytes 11100010 10000010 10101100.
The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

* For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
* For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero.

The other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values,
and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Analysis

I chose to use a state machine:

![UTF-8 validator state machine](states.png)

I chose to use a `Fail` state separate from `Begin`
to allow my program to re-synchronize if bad byte(s) appear in
its input.
Re-synchronization shows up on the diagram above as transitions out of
the Fail state.
Transitions happen on input of a byte, and depend on the unfortunately
variable-sized prefix bits, 0,  10, 110, 1110, 11110
There's a catch all bucket of byte-prefixes, "other",
anything that doesn't have one of those 5 prefixes.

[My program](r1.go) also prints out code points as it finds them.
Transitioning to Begin state means that it can print the code point.

```sh
$ go build r1.go
$ go build mkunicode.go
$ ./mkunicode 2 | ./r1   # can use 0 - 5
```

It's possible to do something other than a state machine and satisfy the
problem statement.
A program could just check byte prefixes, and ensure that "subsequent bytes"
(10xxxxxx pattern bytes) appear in the proper number.
[Such a program](r2.go) can return false at the first incorrect byte prefix.
It's much harder for this program to synchronize after a bad encoding.
It also turns out to require about as much code, even though it does less.
It's also code that looks error-prone.

## Interview Analysis

The problem statement doesn't cover the whole of UTF-8:
a program can re-synchronize with a UTF-8 bytestream after encountering
a goofed up code point.
A single bad byte or even a stream of them doesn't keep a program
like `xterm` from rendering the rest of the stream of bytes.
The problem statement doesn't ask for what valid Unicode code points exist.

Since at least two types of algorithms exist,
a candidate could talk about software engineering issues
when choosing between competing algorithms:
how easy one algorithm is to code versus the other,
the merits of state machinces,
speed to market,
ease of maintenance after the original developer leaves.

Test cases don't suggest themselves based on the problem statement,
which doesn't include synchronizing after a bad byte,
and there are several cases to check there.
The candidate should suggest a valid UTF-8 byte stream with 1, 2, 3 and 4-byte
UTF-8 encodings,
and some invalid byte streams,
where the invalid byte occurs after a "110xxxxx", "110xxxx" and a "11110xxx" byte,
and also a stream with an invalid byte futher out in the "subsequent byte" positions.

I'm not sure this is a great interview problem in general:
unless the candidate knows a fair amount about UTF-8,
the interviewer is probably going to get a byte-prefix-checker.
That's quite a clumsy program,
although the interviewer might get to see heroic struggles.

The state machine implementation,
while easy to reason about,
is also not an "easy" programming task.
This probably deserves a "medium" rating.
